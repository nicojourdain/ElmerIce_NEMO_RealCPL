### CONTOUR Directory

ASCII files containing the list of (x y) values (in meter on the stereographic grid) that limit the area simulated by Elmer/Ice.

Will be used to include the contours of your domains for coupled simulations -> see COUPLING directory.

The contours need to be consistent with ElmerIce Inversions -> see INVERSION directory.

AmundsenBasin_Limits_FG.csv is used by fromVtuToNetcdf.py
